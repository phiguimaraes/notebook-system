This is a project to a IT company that needed to automate their excel.
The system was created to have a interface for the user to put the laptop informartions, when finished they can press to save and everything will be saved in the excel sheet.
To put another notebook info, the user can press to erase everything written.
In this way, the hardware analyst can save their time and have an easier interface to interact.

This project was made with the help from @setprogramacao
